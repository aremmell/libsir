 *
 * ## Intro
 *
 * Using plugins, it is possible to extend libsir's reach when dispatching log
 * messages. A simple example of this would be a plugin that only registers for
 * emergency-level messages. Whenever it receives a message, it posts the message
 * to a REST API endpoint which results in a push notification being sent to a
 * mobile device.
 *
 * Use your imagination; essentially anything is possible. There are some caveats,
 * though: until a thread pool and job queue mechanism can be implemented in libsir
 * ([#121](https://github.com/aremmell/libsir/issues/121)), plugins must either
 * only perform operations that are guaranteed to complete quickly, or perform
 * those operations asynchronously (*i.e., on another thread*).
 *
 * ## Versioning
 *
 * libsir's plugin interface will be versioned; the functions appearing on
 * this page comprise the plugin interface v1. If/when a new function export is
 * added (or one is modified), the version number will be bumped.
 *
 * When plugins are compiled, their interface version is hard-coded in. This means
 * that as libsir continues to evolve (and the version number increases), it can
 * still communicate with older plugins via backwards-compatible versioned
 * interfaces.
 *
 * ## Creating your own plugin
 *
 * The following steps should be taken in order to write your own fully-
 * functioning libsir plugin:
 *
 * - Make a copy of the `plugins/sample` directory (within `plugins`).
 * - Rename the new directory whatever you'd like. The name of the new directory
 * will determine the name of the plugin file that is produced.
 * - Study the implementation of the sample plugin. It is included below for your
 * convenience. Modify your copy to suit your specific needs.
 *
 * @include plugin_sample.c
 *
 * - `cd` back into the root directory of the repository and run `make clean
 * plugins`. If everything goes smoothly, your shiny new plugin should now be
 * located in `build/lib`. If you named your directory 'foo', you shouuld see a
 * `plugin_foo.[so/dll]`.
 * - You can now move the plugin wherever you'd like, and use ::sir_loadplugin
 * to load it (after you've called ::sir_init, of course).
 *
 * If you encounter any problems, rebuild with `env SIR_SELFLOG=1 SIR_DEBUG=1
 * make clean plugins`. This will enable diagnostic output from libsir that
 * should aid in the diagnosis of any issues you encounter. If you're still stuck,
 * [reach out](https://github.com/aremmell/libsir/discussions/new?category=q-a)
 * and somebody will assist you within a reasonable amount of time.
