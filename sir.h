/**
 * @brief Adds a log file and registeres it to receive log output.

 * The levels for which the file will receive output are specified in the

 * ::SIRL_DEFAULT.
 *
 * The formatting options for the log output sent to the file are specified in
 * the `opts` bitmask. If you wish to use the default options, pass
 * ::SIRO_DEFAULT. By default, log files receive all available information.
 *
 * @remark Take note of the ::SIR_FROLLSIZE compile-time constant. When any log
 * file reaches that size in bytes, it will be archived to a date-stamped file
 * in the same directory, and logging will resume at the path of the original file.
 *
 * @remark If `path` is a relative path, it shall be treated as relative
 * to the _current working directory_. This is not necessarily the same path
 * that your process' binary file resides in.
 *
 * @remark The return value from this function is only valid for the lifetime of
 * the process. If a crash or restart occurs, you will no longer be able to refer
 * to the file by that identifier, and will have to add the file again (libsir does
 * not persist its list of log files).
 *
 * @remark To change the file's level registrations or options after adding it,
 * call ::sir_filelevels and ::sir_fileopts, respectively.
 *
 * @see ::sir_remfile
 *
 * @param path        Either a relative or absolute path to a file name which shall
 *                    become a log file managed by libsir.
 * @param levels      Levels of output to register the file for.
 * @param opts        Formatting options for the output sent to the file.
 * @returns sirfileid If successful, a unique identifier that can later be used
 * to modify level registrations, options, or remove the file from libsir. Upon
 * failure, returns `NULL`. Use ::sir_geterror to obtain information about any
 * error that may have occurred.
